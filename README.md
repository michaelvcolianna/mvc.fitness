# mvc.fitness

Web app for friends and I to track our gym stuff: Which exercises, reps, weights, etc. plus tracking rest between sets.

### Todo

- Users and authentication
- Main list of exercise sets
  - Names, descriptions, links to YouTube demos, rest times
  - Fields for number of reps & weight/resistance
- Groups of exercises (e.g. leg day)
  - Name and description of group
  - Add/remove/reorder exercises
  - Modify exercises when adding (e.g. leg press normally 8-10 reps, but specify RP 5-8 at add)
  - Super sets sub-grouping
- Statistics for groups & their exercises
- Timer for rest between sets
